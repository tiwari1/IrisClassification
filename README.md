# IrisClassification
Iris classification using machine learning involves the application of algorithms to distinguish between different species of iris flowers based on their unique characteristics. By analyzing features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, machine learning models can be trained to accurately classify iris flowers into species like setosa, versicolor, and virginica. This task is a classic example of supervised learning, where the model learns from labeled data to make predictions on new, unlabeled iris samples. Through techniques like decision trees, support vector machines, or deep learning neural networks, machine learning enables automated and precise identification of iris species, contributing to various applications in botany, ecology, and horticulture.
